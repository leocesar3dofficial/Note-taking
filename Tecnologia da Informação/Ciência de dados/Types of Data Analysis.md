# Types of Data Analysis

## Descriptive

- Summarizes the data at hand and presents your data in a comprehensible way.

## Exploratory

- Helps discover correlations and relationships between variables.
- Helps discover new connections and form hypotheses.
- Correlation doesn’t imply causation.

## Inferential

- Generalizes a larger population with a sample.
- Accuracy of inference depends on sampling scheme.

## Predictive

- Makes predictions about the future.
- A good prediction depends on the right input variables.
- A simple linear model with enough data usually does the trick.

## Causal

- Finds the cause of a correlation.
- Using a variable to predict another doesn’t denote causal relationships.
- Good data is hard to find, and producing it requires expensive research.
- Results from studies are done in aggregate and are average effects and might not apply to everyone.

## Mechanistic

- Measures the exact changes in variables that lead to other changes in other variables.
