# Data Analysis Competency

## ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)

### Process

1. **Extract**
   - Retrieves raw data from an unstructured data pool and migrates it into a temporary, staging data repository.
2. **Clean**
   - Cleans data extracted from an unstructured data pool, ensuring the quality of the data prior to transformation.
3. **Transform**
   - Structures and converts the data to match the correct target source.
4. **Load**
   - Loads the structured data into a data warehouse so it can be properly analyzed and used.
5. **Analyze**
   - Big data analysis is processed within the warehouse, enabling the business to gain insight from the correctly configured data.

## KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)

### Accounts

- Percentage of overdue invoices.
- Percentage of purchase orders raised in advance.
- Number of retrospectively raised purchase orders.
- Finance report error rate (measures the quality of the report).
- Average cycle time of workflow.
- Number of duplicate payments.

### Marketing and Sales

- New customer acquisition.
- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC).
- Average deal size.
- Demographic analysis of individuals (potential customers).
- Customer density (percentage of revenue).
- Turnover (i.e., revenue) generated by segments of the customer population.
- Outstanding balances held by segments of customers and terms of payment.
- Collection of bad debts within customer relationships.
- Profitability of customers by demographic segments and segmentation of customers by profitability.

### Manufacturing

- Overall equipment effectiveness, OEE = availability x performance x quality.
- Availability = run time / total time.
- Downtime = time the building/location/service/machine is out of operation due to any reason.
- Performance = total count / target counter.
- Quality = good count / total count.
- Cycle time ratio (CTR) = standard cycle time / real cycle time.
- Capacity utilization.
- Rejection rate.

### Professional Services

- Utilization rate = the percentage of time employees spend generating revenue.
- Project profitability = revenue generated by a project / cost of delivering the work.
- Project success rate = the percentage of projects delivered on time and under budget.

### System Operations

- Availability / uptime.
- Mean time between failure.
- Mean time to repair.
- Unplanned availability.
- Unplanned downtime.
- Average time to repair.

### Project Execution

- Earned value.
- Cost variance.
- Schedule variance.
- Estimate to complete.
- Manpower spent / month.
- Money spent / month.
- Planned spend / month.
- Planned manpower / month.
- Average time to delivery.
- Tasks / staff.
- Project overhead / ROI.
- Planned delivery date vs actual delivery date.

### Supply Chain Management

- Sales forecasts.
- Inventory.
- Procurement and suppliers.
- Warehousing.
- Transportation.
- Reverse logistics.

### Human Resource Management

- Employee turnover.
- Ability to recruit to advertised roles.
- Employee performance indicators.
- Staff satisfaction / results of staff surveys.
- Proportion of staff unplanned absence (due to short or long term sickness).
- Cross-functional team analysis.
- Organization contribution to Sector.

## FP&A (Financial Planning and Analysis)

### Activities

- Planning and budgeting.
- Financial planning.
- Management and performance reporting.
- Forecasting and modeling.

## Projects

- Web scraping.

## SQL (Structured Query Language)

- Select and filter data, merge data from multiple tables.
- Do everything else in Pandas.

## Data Wrangling

- Data cleaning.
- Data normalization.
- Data aggregation.
- Treat missing values and outliers.
- Analyze distributions of data and identify skewness.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Correlation plots (for determining feature importance and identifying confounding variables).

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

- Tokenization ou tokenização.
  - dividir o texto da mensagem em palavras isoladas.
- Word stemming, lemmatization.
- TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).

## Machine Learning

### Model Building

- Scoping: do you even need an ML model?
- Feature Engineering.
- Supervised Learning.
  - Linear regression.
  - Logistic regression.
  - CART / decision tree models (helpful for code tests).
- Unsupervised Learning.
  - Clustering, topic models.
  - Deal with class imbalance for multi-label models.

### Model Evaluation

- Identify when models have been overfitted.
- Save models as pickle files, load and inference them.
- Model evaluation with confusion matrix metrics (AUC, precision, recall, accuracy, etc.).
- Analyze distributions of predicted probabilities.
